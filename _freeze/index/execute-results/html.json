Graham has a broad interest across the subject area and continues to work and develop projects to study sea-level change and the use of GIS and remote sensing.\n\nGraham's research primarily focuses on reconstructing sea-level change in order to understand ice-sheet histories and changes to ocean circulation patterns and how these can inform future predictions of environmental change. He combines different types of analysis including fieldwork, laboratory, numerical modelling and spatial analysis in his research and teaching. He has worked at various sites in the UK, as well as places such as the Falkland Islands, Swiss Alps and Antarctica.\n\nGraham originally left education to become a professional footballer with Cambridge United and then went on to become a plasterer. His work eventually took him to help with the build of Halley VI Research Station in Antarctica. This, along with much travelling, including cycling from Los Angeles to Buenos Aires, fired a curiosity and passion for studying and teaching geography. He then went on to study for a BSc and MSc at the University of Gloucestershire before completing his PhD at the University of York.\n\nPlease feel free to [contact me](mailto:g.rush@leedsbeckett.ac.uk) if you have any questions or would like to discuss potential projects.\n\n:::  \n<!-- remove these ::: to put text below image  -->\n\n<!-- ```{=html} -->\n<!-- Text to add link to the source code -->\n<!-- <div  style=\"margin: 30px; text-align: center;\"> -->\n<!-- <a class=\"btn btn-primary\" href=\"https://www.marvinschmitt.com/blog/website-tutorial-quarto/\" role=\"button\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"padding: 15px 30px;\">View the tutorial for this template (+ download link)</a> -->\n<!-- </div> -->\n<!-- ``` -->\n\n",
