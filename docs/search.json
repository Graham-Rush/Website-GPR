    "text": "EXPERIENCE AND INTERESTS\n\n\nEXPERIENCE AND INTERESTS\n\nI originally left education to become a professional footballer with Cambridge United and then went on to become a plasterer. My work eventually took me to Antarctica to help with the build of Halley VI Research Station. This, along with much travelling, fired a curiosity and passion for studying and teaching geography. I then went on to study for a BSc and MSc at the University of Gloucestershire before completing my PhD at the University of York. I have since worked as GIS officer at the British Antarctic Survey and at the Univeristies of York, Leeds and Leeds Beckett.\nI have a great many interests. I am an International runner and have represented England and Great Britain at 10 km and cross-country. I spend as much time as possible outdoors including climbing, biking, wlaking and mountaineering. I have climbed in may locations such as Patagonia, Antarctica the Swiss Alps and Scotland. I am always looking for adventures, both large and small, and have organised and completed adventures, such as cycling from Los Angeles to Buenos Aires, and closer home running a complete loop of the York ring road."
