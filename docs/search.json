    "text": "Experience and interests\n\nI originally left education to become a professional footballer with Cambridge United and then went on to become a plasterer. My work eventually took me to Antarctica to help with the build of Halley VI Research Station. This, along with much travelling, fired a curiosity and passion for studying and teaching geography. I then went on to study for a BSc and MSc at the University of Gloucestershire before completing my PhD at the University of York. I have since worked as GIS officer at the British Antarctic Survey and at the Universities of York, Leeds and Leeds Beckett.\nI have a great many interests. I am an International runner and have represented England and Great Britain at 10 km and cross-country. I spend as much time as possible outdoors including climbing, biking, wlaking and mountaineering. I have climbed in may locations such as Patagonia, Antarctica the Swiss Alps and Scotland. I am always looking for adventures, both large and small, and have organised and completed adventures, such as cycling from Los Angeles to Buenos Aires, and closer home running a complete loop of the York ring road.",

    "text": "Current and past research projects\n\nRISeR\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGlobal sea-level rise is one of our greatest environmental challenges and is predicted to continue for hundreds of years, even if global greenhouse-gas emissions are stopped immediately. However, the range, rates and responses to sea-level rise beyond 2100 are poorly understood.\nSea-level change will not be the same around the world; due to gravitational effects Europe is at far greater risk of sea-level rise should Antarctica melt, than Greenland. RISeR will tackle this critical question - what is the long-term sea-level rise hazard in Europe due to ice-sheet melt?\nTo understand the hazards of long-term ice sheet melt, the RISeR project, is focusing on the Last Interglacial (c. 125,000 years ago) when polar temperatures were 3-5 C warmer (a pattern similar to that predicted in the coming centuries), and global sea level 6-9 m higher.\nBy collecting Last Interglacial sediments preserved offshore in the North Sea, we will reconstruct the rates of sea-level change experienced in the region during this climatically warm period. Using this new dataset RISeR will then provide high-end projections of sea-level rise beyond 2100 for northwest Europe, based upon the reconstructed magnitudes and rates of regional Last Interglacial sea-level change.\nRead more about the project here\n\n\n\nRapid sea-level rise and climate change: lesons from the early Holocene.\n\n\nThe 8.2 ka climate event is the most significant North Atlantic cooling event during the Holocene. Freshwater pulses from the melting Laurentide Ice Sheet draining into the North Atlantic Ocean are commonly thought to be its cause by perturbing the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC). The timing, magnitude and number of freshwater pulses, however, remain uncertain. This is problematic for predicting future climate scenarios because it prevents rigorous testing of coupled ocean–atmosphere climate models against an otherwise excellent test case of climate effects of meltwater inputs into the North Atlantic. To address this gap the project uses sea-level reconstructions to constrain the magnitude and source of the meltwater.\nThe AMOC has been shown to be currently slowing down and, although still debated, some forecasts indicate it could shutdown altogether. The knowledge gained by looking at past events through this project helps inform what causes these changes and the likelihood of a similar scenario occurring in the future.\n\n\n\nHolocene sea-level changes in the South Atlantic\n\n\nHolocene relative sea-level (RSL) data from the Falkland Islands provide important constraints on meltwater contributions from polar ice sheets, both on millennial and centennial timescales, and the processes of Glacial Isostatic Adjustment (GIA). In this project, we aim to reconstruct sea-level change during the last 9,000 years for the Falkland Islands based on analyses of fossil salt-marsh sediments and associated microfossils.",
